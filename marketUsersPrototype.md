## Understand Your Users

Our research tells us that Marriott Bonvoy members have varied vacation plans. Some know exactly where they want to go, while others are still deciding or seeking inspiration. Users like seeing many options but don't enjoy clicking through lots of links. For instance, one user wanted a beach house but didn't find suitable pictures.

## Define and Prototype

### Prototype for "Personalized Destinations" Feature:
- [Link to Prototype](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RsyQSjIweyZDBqOmeMkTBfz1LHijfn9Kn8ytLM-mClw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Prototype Comments:**
- Popup with "Where do you want to go?" appears
- Buttons for "City," "Beach," and "Mountains" provided
- Clicking populates "Recommended for You" with relevant destinations
- Drop-down menu under "Destinations" updates accordingly
- New "Map" section shows recommended destinations
- Clicking destinations drops pins on the map with attractive pictures
- Clicking on the picture of the house then leads to more information about the house, like host's info, more pictures inside the house. 

**LevelUp:**
I was able to add different images inside the house like kitchen, bathroom, living room. I also added guest's profile and ratings.
